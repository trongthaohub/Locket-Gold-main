## 💎 Why Choose Locket Gold Activator Bot?

Unlike other basic scripts or tools, this bot is engineered as a **production-grade system**. It solves the common problems of slowness, API bans, and revocations.

| Feature | This Bot 🚀 | Standard Scripts ❌ |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Performance** | **Zero-Lag Async Core**. Handles thousands of users without freezing. | Single-threaded. Freezes while processing one user. |
| **Reliability** | **Round-Robin Token Rotation**. Distributes load to prevent bans. | Uses 1 token until it dies or gets rate-limited. |
| **Safety** | **Smart Anti-Revoke**. Auto-generates NextDNS profiles to block validation servers. | No protection. Gold disappears after a few hours/days. |
| **User Experience** | **Real-time Queue Updates**. Users know their exact position (`#1`, `#2`...). | Silent failure. Users don't know if it's working. |
| **Architecture** | **Worker Pool**. Scalable system (add 1 or 100 workers easily). | Simple loop. Cannot scale with demand. |

## 🌟 Key Features

### ⚡ **High-Performance Core**
*   **Fully Asynchronous**: Powered by `aiohttp` and `asyncio` for non-blocking I/O. The bot remains responsive to commands even under heavy load.
*   **Worker Pool System**: Configurable number of concurrent workers (`NUM_WORKERS`) to parallelize request processing.

### 🛡️ **Advanced Security**
*   **NextDNS Integration**: Automatically creates a unique DNS profile for each user that blocks `revenuecat.com`, ensuring the Gold subscription sticks.
*   **Strict Cooldowns**: Enforces a 45-second cooldown per token usage to mimic human behavior and avoid detection.

### 🤖 **Smart Automation**
*   **Auto-Resolution**: Just paste a Locket username or link; the bot handles UID resolution automatically.
*   **Queue Management**: FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queue system with live status updates to prevent API flooding.
### 📱 **Telegram Mini App (New!)**
*   **Modern Interface**: Premium glassmorphism UI for a superior mobile experience.
*   **Real-time Interaction**: Watch the exploit progress in a terminal-style view right inside Telegram.
*   **One-Click DNS**: Seamless setup for iOS and Android directly from the app.
*   **Global Stats**: Monitor active users and total requests globally.

# 2. Worker Settings
# Match this number to the number of Token Sets you have to ensure 1-to-1 mapping.
NUM_WORKERS = 2
